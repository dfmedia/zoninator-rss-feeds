# Zoninator RSS Feeds
This plugin provides RSS Feeds for each Zoninator Zone.

## Installation and Usage
Install and activate the plugin like any other WordPress plugin, then flush the permalinks.

#### Usage
Each Zone will have an RSS 2.0 feed at `site.com/feed/zoninator_zones?zone={slug}`

So, if there's a "zone" with the slug of "sports", it can be accessed at `site.com/feed/zoninator_zones?zone=sports`

The feed is RSS 2.0, using the same RSS template as the default feeds WordPress outputs.
