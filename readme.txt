This plugin provides RSS Feeds for each Zoninator Zone.

Each Zone will have an RSS 2.0 feed at site.com/feed/zoninator_zones?zone={slug}

So, if there's a "zone" with the slug of "sports", it can be accessed at site.com/feed/zoninator_zones?zone=sports

The feed is RSS 2.0, using the same RSS template as the default feeds WordPress outputs.
